# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, my name is Sam LeBlanc â€” nice to meet you!
#### I am a first-year Master's candidate at Georgetown University, studying [Data Science for Public Policy](https://mccourt.georgetown.edu/master-of-science-in-data-science-for-public-policy/) at the McCourt School. 

#### Currently, I am interested in developing data visualization tools to explore demographic shifts in the United States. My main project at the moment is called [CensOculus](https://samleblanc.github.io/Census-Mapper/) (literally "Census Eye"), which is an interactive browser-based map for displaying the results of the U.S. Census.

#### When not staring at a screen, I enjoy hiking, skiing, playing chess in the park, and making art with my pen plotter. If you would like to get in contact, shoot me an email at [sdl87@georgetown.edu](mailto:sdl87@georgetown.edu)!
